## About Georgie's Gastronomic Gulag

Welcome, intrepid gourmands (assuming you can stomach a world without sriracha). This blog chronicles the fortunate few recipes that have survived Georgie's iron-fisted culinary regime.

**Georgie: Who is She and Why Should You Care?**

Georgie is a culinary purist, a self-proclaimed champion of "flavor," which in her lexicon translates to "blandness punctuated by the occasional egg." Here's a glimpse into Georgie's...unique...preferences:

* **Spice?** An existential threat. A single rogue chili flake is enough to send Georgie into a meltdown that would make Gordon Ramsay blush.
* **Olives?** An abomination. The mere mention of them sends shivers down Georgie's spine. One can only assume a past life trauma involving a particularly aggressive olive.
* **Eggs?** The cornerstone of civilization. Scrambled, poached, fried, or even (shudder) deviled - all are deemed acceptable offerings to the altar of Georgie's palate.
* **Ginger Beer?** A tolerable beverage, as long as it doesn't get any ideas above its station and try to be interesting.
* **Creme Brulee?** The Mona Lisa of desserts (according to Georgie, at least). A testament to the power of simplicity, as long as you completely ignore the artistry involved in caramelizing the sugar crust.

**Why Trust Georgie?**

Well, that's a question even Georgie might struggle to answer. Let's just say if you're looking for recipes that are guaranteed to be inoffensive to even the most delicate of palates (or simply terrified of her withering judgment), then you've stumbled upon your culinary purgatory.

**Disclaimer:** This blog is not for the adventurous eater. Any attempt to introduce excitement, like, say, a whisper of garlic, to one of these recipes is entirely at your own peril. Georgie cannot, and will not, be held responsible for the resulting disappointment (or, more likely, existential culinary crisis) on your part.

**Proceed with caution (and a side of bland toast).**
