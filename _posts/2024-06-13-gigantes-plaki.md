## Ingredients
* 250g dried gigantes or butter beans
* 3/4 tsp tbsp flaky salt, plus extra to serve
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* 1 garlic clove, peeled
* 25ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to serve
* 1/2 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 celery stick, trimmed and finely chopped
* 1 medium carrot, trimmed and finely chopped
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tbsp red-wine vinegar
* 1 tsp honey, or sugar, to taste
* 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes, or 4 plum tomatoes, chopped

## Method
1. Put the beans in a bowl and add cold water to cover them by about 5cm. Add a tablespoon of flaky salt, stir well to dissolve, then leave to soak for eight to 12 hours.
2. Drain the beans and put all but a small handful (favour any whose skins have already started to split) into a large saucepan. Cover with 5cm fresh water, add another teaspoon of flaky salt, the bay leaves, cinnamon stick and one of the garlic cloves, peeled and squashed with the back of a knife, and bring to a boil.
3. Meanwhile, peel the handful of reserved beans, then add these to the pan and boil hard for 10 minutes. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until just tender, and probably 45 minutes to an hour.
4. While the beans are cooking, pour the oil into an ovenproof dish for which you have a lid and set it over a gentle heat. Add the onion, celery and carrot, and fry, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Peel and crush or finely chop the remaining garlic clove, add this to the fried vegetable mix, along with the oregano, and fry for another minute.
5. Stir in the vinegar, honey and tomatoes, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for five minutes. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
6. Drain the beans, reserving their cooking liquid, then stir about 300ml of the bean water into the sauce dish. Stir in the beans and aromatics, bring everything to a boil, cover and transfer to the oven for 40 minutes.
7. Take off the lid and put the dish back in the oven for a final 15 minutes, stirring in a little more of the cooking water first if the beans look a little dry. Leave to cool to warm, then check the seasoning, adjusting if necessary. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve.
